# AtliQ Business 360 - Power BI Project

## Problem Statement

### Background
AtliQ Hardware is a growing company with multiple departments such as sales, finance, supply chain, executive, marketing, and products. Each department operates in silos, generating and managing its data independently. This siloed approach leads to fragmented insights and hampers the company's ability to make informed, data-driven decisions at the corporate level.

### Challenges
- **Data Fragmentation:** Each department maintains its own data, leading to inconsistent and non-integrated insights.
- **Lack of Unified Metrics:** There is no standardized set of metrics to evaluate the performance across different departments.
- **Inefficient Decision-Making:** Decision-making processes are slow and less effective due to the lack of a holistic view of the business.
- **Manual Reporting:** Departments rely on manual reporting processes that are time-consuming and prone to errors.
- **Limited Accessibility:** Key stakeholders do not have easy access to real-time data, limiting their ability to respond to business changes promptly.

- **Create Dashboards:** Design and implement an interactive, multi-view Power BI dashboard that provides real-time insights.
- **Enable Data-Driven Decisions:** Equip stakeholders with the tools and insights necessary to make informed, timely decisions.
- **Automate Reporting:** Streamline reporting processes to reduce manual effort and increase accuracy.

### Expected Outcomes
- **Improved Data Visibility:** Stakeholders will have access to a centralized, real-time dashboard with insights from all departments.
- **Enhanced Decision-Making:** Unified metrics and integrated data will enable more effective and quicker decision-making.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Automated reporting will free up resources and reduce errors, improving overall operational efficiency.
- **Business Growth:** By leveraging data-driven insights, AtliQ Hardware aims to improve its business performance and achieve a 10% increase in business progress.
